//Library

Both the libray and the framework are used for the software development process
eg for library : Jquery and eg for the framework is the expressjs
Both are used to make writing the code more effecient and quickly 
But the working of both are different .
We can use the library any time we want . It is a predefined code. 
The developer has control over the library . 
The library doesn't dictate the structure of the application.
The libraries are focused on solving problems or specific tasks 

//Framework

It is pre-built architecture that provides a set of rules,conventions and components for 
building an application.
Framework is a pre-written code that provides structure for the software .
using it also we get limit the size of the code and make the software effecient.

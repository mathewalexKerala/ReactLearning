When we add a script tag to a html document . The browser would immediately executes the script before the loading of the html contents . The could reduce the loading speed. 
Inorder to counter that we use defer and async 

//defer 

When we give defer attribute in the script tag the browser would render the html document and also download the script in the background . 
The script is executed immediately after it has been downloaded . It doesn't matter whether the html has completed it's loading . 
This may cause problem if the script depends on resources such as images , css etc in the html .


//async 

This attribute allows browser to download the script in the background and executes it only after the complete rendering of the html contents.
If the script depends on the resources such as the css and images . It would only executes after the rendering of the html contents.And the DOM has finished loading.
